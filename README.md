PART 1 – Implement the sorting algorithm

Given the following array A = [84, 23, 62, 44, 16, 30, 95, 51], implement a program to sort the array using the following algorithm:

a) Counting Sort
b) Radix Sort

Provide the pseudocode, implement the algorithm using Python, explain the codes/algorithm, and explain running time complexity of each algorithm.

PART 2 – Implement the String Matching Algorithm

Given a String “algorithmisfun”, search for the word “fun” in the String by applying the following algorithms:

- [ ] Rabin-karp Algorithm
- [ ] KMP Algorithm
- [ ] TRIES

Provide the pseudocode, implement the algorithm using Python, explain the codes/algorithm, and explain running time complexity of each algorithm.
